/**
 * "Fruit-juice" package is a simple dependency injection library for Ngauto.
 *  Guice is a sophisticated and very feature rich library and at the same time complicated library.
 *
 *  The basic idea of "Fruit-juice" is to provide a dependency injection functions based on values (configurations) given
 *  by annotations attached to afield to be injected.
 *
 *  Guice's main idea is to inject field values specified by "conditions" like their types, attached annotations, etc.
 *  Therefore you cannot do something like this without using "@Named" annotation and it would make things complicated
 *  than it originally can be.
 *
 * (t.b.d.)
 *
 *  Unlike Guice, FruitJuice can only inject public fields, and cannot do it for constructors, methods, private fields, etc.
